# Battleship
Developed a text-based Battleship game where the computer randomly places a ship on a grid, and the user has multiple attempts to guess its location. The game provides feedback for each guess, indicating whether it is a "Hit!" or "Miss!" and updates a hit array to track progress. The user is prompted to enter valid guesses within the range of 0-19, with error handling for invalid input. The game ends when the user successfully hits all segments of the ship, and the total number of guesses is displayed.
